- I’m Om Arora, known online mostly as NoobHacker or NoobHacker9999.
- I like anything and everything related to computers.
- I do CTF's in my free time with my team [n00bzUnit3d](https://n00bzunit3d.xyz/) (site still under development).
- If I get more free time, I try to upload videos to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKXw0AvIsh_x3YbqsVg8O8w).
- And if there's more time, then I update my [website](https://creativerobotics.org/)
